**Project Title: OFFPAY**

**Description:**  
This project aims to develop an innovative payment solution that enables users to conduct transactions without relying on internet connectivity. The Offline UPI Payment Solution is designed to address the challenges faced by individuals in rural and semi-urban areas of India, where internet access is limited or unreliable. By leveraging technologies such as USSD, SMS, and NFC, we aim to facilitate digital payments for users who depend on feature phones and have low digital literacy.

**Key Features:**  
- **Offline Transaction Capability:** Users can perform transactions without internet access.  
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed for ease of use, catering to individuals with low digital literacy.  
- **Secure Transactions:** Implementing encryption methods to ensure the safety and privacy of users' financial data.  
- **Data Synchronization:** Automatic syncing of transaction data with servers once internet connectivity is restored.  

**Motivation:**  
Despite the increasing adoption of digital payment systems like UPI, a significant portion of the population in rural areas faces barriers due to inconsistent internet access and reliance on basic mobile phones. This project aims to bridge that gap by providing a reliable offline payment solution.

**Objectives:**  
- Increase digital payment adoption in underserved communities.  
- Enhance financial inclusion by making UPI services accessible to all.  
- Support government initiatives aimed at promoting cashless transactions.

**Technologies Used:**  
- USSD for real-time transaction processing.  
- SMS for notifications and confirmations.  
- NFC for quick and secure payments.

**Prototype and Development:**  
The prototype of the application is available for review and testing. We are continuously gathering user feedback to improve the system's functionality and user experience.
